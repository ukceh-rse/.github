# UKCEH RSE group

We are the RSE group within [@NERC-CEH](https://github.com/NERC-CEH), working closely with @ukceh-ds, @ukceh-devops, ..., and research scientists.

This GitHub organisation mostly serves to manage our own affairs without cluttering up a space shared with the wider organisation. Most of the work we are involved with is hosted on [@NERC-CEH](https://github.com/NERC-CEH).

Feel free to get in touch with us (how?), drop into our [discussions](https://github.com/ukceh-rse/Discussions) or ...
